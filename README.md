# Django-with-Multiple-Database

Used mysql and sqlite3 databases.  Can use two or three mysql or postgresql. Have to add some databases description at settings.py at Databases section.Create routers.py under 'theapp' and all models under that app would be stored into mysql database called 'customer'. Can create router file anywhere in your project. That doesn't affect . Only app_label matters. Just created routersLocal.py for the django default apps .They would be stored in default sqlite database. If We got two databases and don't define router for the apps, all models of the app would be saved in both databases. Have to add the path of the routers to the DATABASE_ROUTERS in settings.py.
