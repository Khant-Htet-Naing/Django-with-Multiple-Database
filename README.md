# Django-with-Multiple-Database

I just used mysql and sqlite3 databases for now. You can use two or three mysql or postgresql. Have to add some databases description at settings.py at Databases section. I create routers.py under 'theapp' and all models under that app would be stored into mysql database called 'customer'. You can create router file anywhere in your project. That doesn't affect . Only app_label matters. I just created routersLocal.py for the django default apps .They would be stored in default sqlite database. If I got two databases and don't define router for the apps . All models of the app would be created in both databases.Finally I have to add the path of the routers to the DATABASE_ROUTERS in settings.py.
